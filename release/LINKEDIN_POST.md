DialogForge is now open source.

DialogForge is a lightweight system for generating grounded synthetic multi-turn dialogues with an OpenAI-compatible stack, async batching, deterministic dedup, configurable judging, resumable runs, and export-ready artifacts.

DialogForge is developed by **MBZUAI-IFM Paris Lab**.

Today's release includes:
- the codebase,
- a sanitized sample dataset on Hugging Face,
- and a PyPI package.

This release aligns with our open-science and open-source AI commitments: reproducibility, reuse, and transparent iteration.

If you work on synthetic data, multilingual QA, or evaluation pipelines, we'd value your feedback and contributions.
