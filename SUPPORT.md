# Support

## Support Model

DialogForge is community-led and maintained on a best-effort basis.
There is no guaranteed response time and no SLA.

## Where to Ask for Help

- Usage questions: open a GitHub Discussion (or issue if Discussions are unavailable).
- Bugs: open a GitHub issue with a minimal reproduction.
- Security concerns: follow `SECURITY.md` and report privately.

## What to Include in Support Requests

- DialogForge version or commit SHA
- Python version and OS
- relevant config excerpts (without secrets)
- command run and complete error message
- expected vs actual behavior

## Support Boundaries

We can usually help with:
- reproducible bugs in documented CLI/config behavior
- docs clarity issues
- release artifact generation and Hugging Face export flow

We may not be able to provide deep support for:
- private infrastructure constraints
- custom forks with major behavior divergence
- vendor/service outages outside this repository
